# Pixel-Art-Maker
Udacity Nanodegree Final Lab: Pixel Art Maker

#### Our app will have:

1. Color picker/input to change the color of our brush
2. A reset button to reset our grid
3. A input through which we can set the size of our pixels/grid

### Creating our Pixel Art Maker

- First create the webpage using HTML

- Then style the page using CSS

- Now in our JavaScript lets populate the container with divs 
- We will create a helper function called **populate** for that
- Okay so now when we press down our mouse and move it, we want to color
- So lets add 2 eventlisteners on our pixels
> mouseover
> mousedown 
- Now lets make the reset button work. When the reset button is clicked 
we simply have to empty out the inner html of our container and call 
the populate function again.
- And finally when we change the value of our input we 
want to create a new grid with the entered size.

#### There we have created a pixel art maker and can draw an image on the grid using the click of the mouse.
